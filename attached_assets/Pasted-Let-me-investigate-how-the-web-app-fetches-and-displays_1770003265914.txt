Let me investigate how the web app fetches and displays episode descriptions on the Episode Details page to understand what might be missing in the mobile implementation.

Let me check exactly what data is passed when saving an episode and what the `ensure-episode-metadata` function expects:

I found the issue. Let me trace the complete flow:

Now I understand the root cause. Here's the full picture:

## Root Cause Analysis

**The description is NOT stored in `saved_episodes`** (which is correct). The mobile app must fetch episode details from `episode_metadata` via the `get-episode-details` edge function when displaying the Episode Details page.

### Web App Flow:

1. **Saving an episode**: Inserts into `saved_episodes` (no description) → fires `ensure-episode-metadata` (creates `episode_metadata` record, but web doesn't pass description here either)

2. **Navigating to Episode Details**: The web app calls `get-episode-details` which:
   - Fetches from `episode_metadata` table
   - **If description is null, fetches from Taddy API and backfills** (lines 247-280 of `get-episode-details/index.ts`)
   - Returns the complete episode data including description

### What the mobile app is likely doing wrong:

1. **Not calling `get-episode-details`** when showing the Episode Details page
2. Instead, trying to display data from `saved_episodes` (which doesn't have description)

### The Fix for Replit:

The mobile Episode Details screen must call `get-episode-details` with the episode slug to get the full data including description:

```typescript
// Mobile should do this when showing Episode Details
const { data } = await supabase.functions.invoke('get-episode-details', {
  body: { slug: episodeSlug }
});

// data.episode will contain:
// - name, podcastName, imageUrl, audioUrl, durationSeconds
// - description (backfilled from Taddy if needed)
// - briefSlug (if a brief exists)
```

Would you like me to update the Mobile documentation to clarify this critical flow - that Episode Details must call `get-episode-details` for the description (and Taddy backfill) to work?
