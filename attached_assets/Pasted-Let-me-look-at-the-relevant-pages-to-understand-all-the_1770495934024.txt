Let me look at the relevant pages to understand all the upgrade banner logic across the web app.

Now I have a clear picture of all the upgrade/credit banner rules. Here's a summary:

## Upgrade Banner Rules in the Web App

The banner logic is **identical** on both the **Library** (`/library`) and **Shows** (`/shows`) pages. There are three mutually exclusive banners, shown based on the user's `plan` and `credits`:

---

### 1. **Upgrade Banner (Free Users)**
- **Condition:** `!isPro` (user is on the free plan)
- **Icon:** `AlertTriangle` if `credits === 0`, otherwise `Sparkles`
- **Title:** `"You're out of credits"` if `credits === 0`, otherwise `"Upgrade to Pro"`
- **Subtitle:** `"Upgrade to Pro to continue creating briefs"` if `credits === 0`, otherwise `"Get 30 credits per month"`
- **CTA:** "Upgrade to Pro" button → navigates to `/pricing?source=shows` (or `source=library`)

---

### 2. **Zero Credits Banner (Pro Users)**
- **Condition:** `credits === 0 && isPro`
- **Icon:** `AlertTriangle`
- **Title:** `"You're out of credits"`
- **Subtitle:** `"Need more? Get 10 extra credits for $5"`
- **CTA:** "Refill Credits" button → triggers `handleCreditRefill` (Stripe credit top-up checkout)

---

### 3. **Low Credits Banner (Pro Users)**
- **Condition:** `credits > 0 && credits <= 5 && isPro`
- **Icon:** `AlertTriangle`
- **Title:** `"Running low on credits"`
- **Subtitle:** `"{credits} remaining — get 10 extra credits for $5"`
- **CTA:** "Refill Credits" button → triggers `handleCreditRefill`

---

### Key Rules:
- **Only one banner shows at a time** — the conditions are mutually exclusive (`!isPro` vs `isPro && credits === 0` vs `isPro && credits > 0 && credits <= 5`)
- **Pro users with >5 credits see no banner**
- **Free users always see a banner** (either "out of credits" or "upgrade to Pro")
- **Both pages also handle `?payment=success` and `?refill=success`** query params to show toast notifications and refresh the profile after returning from Stripe
